# Phase retrieval algorithm
MATLAB code for estimate of the zernike coefficients of aberration based on phase diversity images

Scripts and functions:
1) recon_zern.m: key function for estimating aberrated phase (Zernike coefficients) from phase diversity images and known phases (Zernike coefficients). It calls two subfunctions -- zernretrieve_pre and zernretrieve_loop; 
2) test_recon_zern_simu.m: example to reconstruct aberrated phase (Zernike coefficients) based on simulated images; 
2) test_recon_zern_exp.m: example to reconstruct aberrated phase (Zernike coefficients) based on experimental images.
