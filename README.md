comAO: computational adaptive optics
===
---
Adaptive optics for fluorescence microscopy based on phase diversity method. It is an early-version code to our paper: [Phase diversity-based wavefront sensing for fluorescence microscopy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.19.572369v3).

1. **PhaseDiversity**: MATLAB code for phase retrieval algorithm, estimating the Zernike coefficients of aberrations based on phase diversity images.

2. **ControlSoftware**: LabVIEW code for controlling the data acquisition and AO correction for the microscope.

3. **DataForTest**: examples of simulated and experimental data.
